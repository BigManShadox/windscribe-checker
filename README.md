# Description
This is a proof of concept multi-threaded tool that can check up to 500 logins per minute (personal experience) for the Windscribe VPN service. This tool does **not** log subscription or data usage (*as of yet*).

# Usage
Simple enter the number of threads and proxy settings (HTTP, Socks4, Socks5) and watch the tool output valid logins in green while documenting things like CPM (checks per minute), hits, failed logins and errors in the console title.

# Additional Info
This is my first time making such a tool, and the code could be better. This is also my first account on GitHub and my first time using GitHub and even a markdown file, so please excuse any mistakes.
